AI-Driven Personalized Content Recommendations
Overview
This project explores the use of VARK (Visual, Aural, Read/Write, Kinesthetic) learning styles and Brain Dominance traits to develop an AI-driven system for personalized educational content recommendations. By leveraging these frameworks, the system adapts learning materials to individual preferences, improving engagement and outcomes.

Project Goals
Utilize VARK learning styles to understand students' preferences.
Integrate Brain Dominance traits to analyze cognitive strengths.
Build a recommendation system that provides personalized learning paths.
Use AI/ML techniques to predict learning preferences and recommend content.
Features
Data Collection: Tracks student behavior, including time spent on videos, scroll depth, and progress.
AI-Driven Recommendations: Employs machine learning models to predict learning styles and recommend content.
Personalized Learning Paths: Tailors educational materials to individual learning styles and brain dominance traits.
